              special teaching skills and approach to subjects such as history

              the partner in ‘crime’, Giorgi Tsituri’s teaching style may
              involve storytelling, interactive discussions, and possibly
              integrating music, or theater drama play into his lessons to
              create an immersive and dynamic learning experience for the
              teenagers. Giorgi Tsituri’s aim is not just to impart knowledge
              but also to instill a deep appreciation and understanding of the

            Together with Teo Tsotsolashvili, his spouse and the partner in
            ‘crime’, Giorgi Tsituri’s teaching style may involve storytelling,
            interactive discussions, and possibly integrating music, or theater
            drama play into his lessons to create an immersive and dynamic
            learning experience for the teenagers. While Teo specializes in
            presenting and writing about art (Social media, broadcasting
            companies, magazines and etc.), Giorgi’s aim is not just to impart
            knowledge but also to instill a deep appreciation and understanding
            of the cultural and historical significance of these subjects.
            Working as the Radio DJ in her 20s and having master’s degree in
            economics later, Teo deeply analyzes where is the intersection of
            the art and numbers, business and hobbies. Together they teach their
            young student to observe the world around them and express
            themselves through their unique artistic voice.
