            of the cultural and historical significance of these subjects.
            Working as the Radio DJ in her 20s and having master’s degree in
            economics later, Teo deeply analyzes where is the intersection of
            the art and numbers, business and hobbies. Together they teach their
            young student to observe the world around them and express
            themselves through their unique artistic voice.
